# FdF
Building a map in 3D using "wireframe" graphics (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project).

Install:
  Run the "make" command (only for Linux or macOS).
  
Run:
  run the "./fdf" command, which takes the path to the map file as an argument (examples of mapss are in the "test_maps" folder)
